      content: `
        My journey in technology began with a fascination for computers at a young age, tinkering with hardware and writing my first lines of code in BASIC. In college, I pursued a degree in Computer Science, where I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles.

        My professional career started as a Junior Developer at a fast-paced startup, where I quickly learned the importance of agile development and teamwork. Over the years, I advanced to more senior roles, taking on responsibilities such as leading development teams, architecting scalable cloud solutions, and mentoring junior engineers.

        I have worked across various industries, including fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce, delivering impactful projects such as cloud migrations, microservices architectures, and automation pipelines. My passion for continuous learning has driven me to earn certifications in AWS and DevOps, and to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in technology.

        Today, I am a Senior Software Engineer, collaborating with cross-functional teams to build innovative products and drive digital transformation. I am committed to fostering a culture of excellence, sharing knowledge, and inspiring the next generation of engineers.
